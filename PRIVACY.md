# Privacy Policy for markdown_2_suite

Last Updated: July 10, 2025

When using the markdown_2_suite plugin, we are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Information We Collect

This plugin does not collect, store, or transmit personal data. All processing is local to your runtime environment.

## How Data Is Used

Input Markdown content is processed only to generate output files. No input or output data is sent to third-party services.

## Data Retention

The plugin does not retain user data after processing. Temporary files, when used, are managed by local runtime logic.

Because the plugin runs in your controlled environment, data security depends on your host and workspace controls.
